# Compendium Folders

This is a module which allows you to manage compendiums a bit easier by implementing a folder system.

This is in early development, but I plan on adding stuff found in the Future section below.

v0.1.0 converts the static submenus in the Compendium directory to be folders, and allows you to collapse/open each subsection. 
(This also should work in the compendium window)

## Future

1. Move compendiums between folders
2. Create/Rename/Update/Delete folders
3. ???
