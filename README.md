# Compendium Folders

This is a module which allows you to manage compendiums a bit easier by implementing a folder system.

This is in early development, but I plan on adding stuff found in the Future section below.

v0.1.3 Introduces a full Create/Update/Delete folder system, which allows you to move compendiums between folders

NOTE This latest update makes my previous module Compendium Hider redundant. You can now hide compendiums by removing a compendium from a folder.

## Future

1. ~~Move compendiums between folders~~
2. ~~Create/Rename/Update/Delete folders~~
3. Nesting folders
4. ???
